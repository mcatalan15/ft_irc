/* The main purpose of the IRC protocol is to provide a base for clients
   to communicate with each other.  PRIVMSG and NOTICE are the only
   messages available which actually perform delivery of a text message
   from one client to another - the rest just make it possible and try
   to ensure it happens in a reliable and structured manner.*/
